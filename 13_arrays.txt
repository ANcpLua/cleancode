nt count = response.body().getKids().size();

mSpinnerList = new ArrayList<KidSpinnerHolder>(count);

for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    String name = response.body().getKids().get(i).getKid().getName();
    int id = response.body().getKids().get(i).getKid().getId();
    names[i] = name;
    mSpinnerList.add(new KidSpinnerHolder(id, name));
}

Actually here we can replace raw strings array with LinkedList as from the provided logic we just want
to append to the end and linked list is good for that purpose.

List<String> names = new LinkedList<String>;
...
names.add(name)

private static final String[] studentIds = new String[MAX_STUDENTS]; // Array to store student IDs
private static final String[] studentNames = new String[MAX_STUDENTS]; // Array to store student names
private static final int[][] studentMarks = new int[MAX_STUDENTS][2]; // Array to store student marks
private static int studentCount = 0; // Current number of students

Author of this project could use a simple hashset instead and save every student using its id as key.
Just override hashcode method and return student's id.He would also need to create a separate data structure
for a student.

private final Set<Student> students = new HashSet<Student>();
...
class Student {
    private final String id;
    ...
}

int[] guesses = new int[99];
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int numberOfTries = 0;
boolean flag = true;

while (flag) {
    System.out.print("Guess the number: ");
    int guess = sc.nextInt();
    Arrays.sort(guesses);
    ...
    guesses[numberOfTries] = guess;
    numberOfTries++;
    
Even in this small game we see a dangerous error - favourite out of bound exception. The guy could create a custom OrderedArray
class but even without such effort simple use of ArrayList which can be used with Array.sort and binary search AND
just using add on place of direct index access will prevent us from error. Because if number of tries becomes 100,
and as I see there is no check for that we get an uncaught exception.

 int[] arrOfint = new int[500];
 JCheckBox[] cb= new JCheckBox[100];
 ...
 int j=1;
 while(rs1.next()){
    arrOfint[j]=rs1.getInt("id");
    ...
    cb[j].setPreferredSize(new Dimension(758,326));*/
    jpan.add(cb[j]);
    jpan.add(jLabels);
    j++;
}

Here we see another problem - first element remains untouched, because assignment starts with index #1. And the logic
here is pretty straightforward, we need both arrays for just storing items appending them to the end.
Use Dequeue!

class EmployeeManager {
    private String[] employeeNames = new String[100];
    private int[] employeeIds = new int[100];
    private int count = 0;
    
Again we see limitations in terms of array size and potential index access problems. Solution - use HashMap!

private Map<Integer, String> employees = new HashMap<>();
