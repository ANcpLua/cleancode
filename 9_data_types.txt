1) if (cookieFile.Trim() == "0" || string.IsNullOrEmpty(cookieFile.Trim()))

Here I would introduce a new bool variable isEmptyCookie and assign to it this expression inside if.

Outcome : By doing this way we can improve program readability .

bool isEmptyCookie = cookieFile.Trim() == "0" || string.IsNullOrEmpty(cookieFile.Trim());

if (isEmptyCookie)...

2) Authenticator auth = new STMPAuthenticator("");
   ...
   ((STMPAuthenticator)auth).setEmail(fromAddress);
   ...
   ((STMPAuthenticator)auth).getPasswordAuthentication()

Unclear type casts, either assign a SMTPAuthenticator to a variable or check maybe a method you want to use
is already in the interface.

So either:

auth.setEmail(fromAddress);
auth.getPasswordAuthentication();

or

STMPAuthenticator auth = new STMPAuthenticator("");

Outcome : By doing this way we avoid unneccesary type casts and increase readability.

3) ArrayList<Object> temp = skillsDao.selectAll();
   ArrayList<Skill> s = new ArrayList<Skill>();
		
   for(int i =0; i<temp.size(); i++)
   {
      s.add(((Skill)temp.get(i)));
   }

Returning Object from a method in most cases indicates bad types system. Like we see here : we return a list of objects and then have to cast it to a Skill type.
I would rework selectAll() method and return a List of ready Skill objects.

Outcome : By doing this we would increase robustness of the program by making it type safe and as a bonus also improve its logic.


4) public abstract double GrossEarnings { get; }
   public double Tax { get { return GrossEarnings * 0.2; } }
   public double NetEarnings { get { return GrossEarnings - Tax; } }

When working with financial operations it could make sense to use BigDecimal which offers methods for presice manipulations.
Maybe it could be the case here as well.

Outcome : By using BigDecimal we improve our calculations precision.

5) if(uid.equals("admin") && pass.equals("admin"))

Adding a new boolean isAdminUser will make sure that we can easily change the condition of checking admin user
and increase code readability as well. And we can also turn this into a function because as I see in the owner's repo it is repeated 3 times...

6) int drawableWidth = drawable.getIntrinsicWidth();
   int drawableHeight = drawable.getIntrinsicHeight();
   float scaleX = ((float) bounds.width()) / drawableWidth;
   float scaleY = ((float) bounds.height()) / drawableHeight;
   matrix = new Matrix();
   matrix.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

Missing check for possible null division or even negative values(scale can not be negative). So adding an if before and doing something is highly appreciated.

if (drawableWidth < 0 || drawableHeight < 0) {...}

Outcome : By adding this if check we ensure that we have one potential error less in our runtime.

7) float[] mTempStartValues = new float[9];

   float[] mTempEndValues = new float[9];

Also example from previous repo : does not use float for better precision. Solution - use double :)

Outcome : By using double we increase floating point calculations precision.

8) if (user != null &&
    user.isAuthenticated() &&
    user.hasPermission("PROCESS_ORDER") &&
    order != null &&
    order.isValid() &&
    order.hasItems() &&
    !order.isProcessed())

Scary if found on the Internet. But if we simply add two boolean variables : isUserAuthorized and isOrderProcessable
then we again improve readability and can easier understand the point of both bool values when it comes to changes.

Outcome : Self explanatory - maintainance and readability.

9) if ( $shake_error_codes && $wp_error->has_errors() && in_array( $wp_error->get_error_code(), $shake_error_codes, true ) ) {
		add_action( 'login_footer', 'wp_shake_js', 12 );
	}

This time found in a php project. Let's introduce a new variable called errorFound or errorCodeFound

$errorCodeFound = $shake_error_codes && $wp_error->has_errors() && in_array( $wp_error->get_error_code(), $shake_error_codes, true )

Now we have a context that if an error is found the form is shaken.

if ($errorCodeFound) add_action(...)

Outcome : maintainance and readability increase + provide context.

10) public void Payment(double price, int idx)
    {
        var convertedPrice = price / idx;
        _bitcoinPay.DoTransaction(convertedPrice);
    }

No check for potential idx 0 value and negative values. Add an if before division and optionaly throw an exception or add a default value

if (idx < 0) { do smth. }

Outcome : By adding this if check we ensure that we have one potential error less in our runtime. And also avoid logic errors as proces can not be negative.

11) sum.Value = addend1 + addend2;
    difference.Value = minuend - subtrahend;
    product.Value = multiplicand * multiplier;
    quotient.Value = dividend / divisor;
    startButton.Enabled = true;

Add check before division to avoid pure null division.

if (divisor == 0) throw ....;

Outcome : By adding this if check we ensure that we have one potential error less in our runtime.

12)  if (bp.GetDepositAddress(((BTCPayNetwork)_btcPayNetworkProvider.GetNetwork(paymentMethodId.CryptoCode)).NBitcoinNetwork) is BitcoinAddress)

Although the type cast is pretty straightforward here this long if is hard on the eyes. And it is also not clear right after looking at the expression what this chain actually does.
So isBitcoinWallet or isBitcoinAddress can introduce the context.

Outcome : maintainance and readability increase + provide context.
