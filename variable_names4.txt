1) Sum_Item_Price -> itemPriceSum
2) Banking_System obj -> BankingSystem bankingSystem
3) submissionObj -> submission
4) institutionList -> institutions
5) _appointmentsRetriever & _appointmentFinder -> the owner of repo where I found it just split search "by Id" and "bulk(retrieving all entities)"
to two different classes, so it was unclear for me whar two classes with identical names do, it would just make sense
to use his _appointmentRepository or make one service class but not how it is now...
6) SnakeItem piece_1, piece_2 -> author of this project probably meant firstPiece and lastPiece
7) framesAtLoad -> I would add here a suffix at the end because for now it is unclear what timespan they use, it just can not be infered from code...
8) private ShipMenu shipObj -> shipMenu
9) NoticeBoardManager nm & var nb = await nm.GetAsync(id) -> in context of current lesson I can say that the names just look similar.
In context of the whole course they just look awful...
10) double Input1, Input2 -> in calculator project in will make more sense to make firstOperand and secondOperand
11) string stringInput -> userInput could sound better, as string gives us nothing again...
12) Form form = new ItemF(_httpClient, selectedItem.ID); -> itemForm, form is too generic
