1) Customer(String name, String email, String password, String phone, String address, int age) {
        RandomGenerator random = new RandomGenerator();
        random.randomIDGen();
        this.name = name;
        this.userID = random.getRandomNumber();
        this.email = email;
        this.password = password;
        this.phone = phone;
        this.address = address;
        this.age = age;
        this.flightsRegisteredByUser = new ArrayList<>();
        this.numOfTicketsBookedByUser = new ArrayList<>();
    }

I would put all parameters into a separate class for more cohesion, call it CustomerDetails and then create a static factory method FromDeatils

public static Customer FromDetails(CustomerDetails details) {...}


2) Position(int x, int y); Position(int x); Position(int y)

During our oop course we had to programm different console games and this class was everywhere.
Now I know how all my overloaded constructors should look like :)

public static Position OnXAxis(int x);
public static Position OnYAxis(int x);
public static Position AtCoordinates(int x);

3) public QueueConnector(Queue<T> qnew);

public static QueueConnector fromQueue(Queue<T> qnew) would increase readability



3.2

1) public interface IFlying

I would rename it to Flyable to emphisize the ability to fly and not just the action.


2) public interface Messageable {
    void sendMessage();
    String getMessage();
}

Messageable is too weird, Communicator seems to be better

3) public interface Cardable {}

I think for a poker game having a Card interface could be more concise.
